1. Installation

We use React with Vite because it's simple and faster than create react app method

Command - npm create vite@latest client
		npx create react app folder_name
	
Dependencies - packages that are used in the project with its version number
Dev dependencies - that are used in development phase only not in testing or production env

Install tailwind from its website and follow necessary steps

2. Create pages and Routes of pages

Link:
Part of the React Router library. Used to create clickable links on the UI that trigger navigation to different routes. You define the destination route using the "to" prop. 

Route:
Defines a mapping between a URL path and a React component. When a user visits a URL matching a route's "path" attribute, the corresponding component is rendered. Used to manage the different views or pages within your application based on the URL. 

While linking Home, About...pages to redirect to its respective pages, we didn't use anchor tag because it refreshes the page, hence we used Link from react

In API, the file is index.js, because in package.json file mail file name is Index.js, we can change the filename based on main file name present in index.js

When set to "module", the type field allows a package to specify all .js files within are ES modules. If the "type" field is omitted or set to "commonjs", all .js files are treated as CommonJS.

3. Connect to the DB (MongoDB)

While connecting to DB, we require URI from DB platform, but we store that URI in .env file for security purposes.

URI - Uniform Resource identifier which identifies a resource
URL - Uniform Resource Locator which locates it.

URL is a type of URI

3. Creating User models
